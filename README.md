- Work with the `/proc` filesystem
- Parse system data efficiently
- Manage dynamic terminal display
- Improve low-level systems programming skills

## Technologies Used

- C language
- Unix system calls
- `/proc` filesystem
- Process management
- Makefile

## Implemented Features

- Reading process information from `/proc`
- Displaying active processes
- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory usage retrieval
- Dynamic screen refresh
- Error handling
